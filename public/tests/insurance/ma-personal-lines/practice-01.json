      "question": "Which distinct characteristic of an insurance contract signifies that the contract is drafted by one party (the insurer) and accepted by the other (the applicant), where ambiguities are generally resolved in favor of the insured?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Aleatory",
        "B": "Unilateral",
        "C": "Adhesion",
        "D": "Conditional"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "An insurance policy is a contract of adhesion. This means it is drafted by the insurer and accepted by the applicant. Since the insurer drafts the language, any ambiguity is generally decided by a court in favor of the insured.",
      "distractor_logic": "Aleatory refers to unequal exchange of value. Unilateral means only one party makes a promise. Conditional means the contract requires specific conditions to be met."

        "D": "A pothole in a driveway"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A morale hazard results from the indifferent or careless attitudes of an insured, such as leaving a car unlocked with keys in the ignition.",
