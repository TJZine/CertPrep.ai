        "B": "Unilateral",
        "C": "Adhesion",
        "D": "Conditional"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Chapter 1-2 states that an insurance policy is a contract of adhesion ('drafted by the insurer'). Therefore, 'any language that is confusing... may be decided by a court in favor of the person who did not draft the language (i.e., the insured).'",

        "D": "They issue non-participating policies"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Stock insurers are owned by stockholders. Mutual insurers are the ones owned by policyholders. Therefore, the statement that stock insurers are owned by policyholders is the exception (false statement).",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Chapter 2-2 and 2-14 classify installing a sprinkler system as Risk Reduction, which 'lessen[s] the severity of losses' rather than preventing them entirely.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A involves avoiding the activity entirely. Option B involves insurance. Option D involves paying for the loss oneself."
