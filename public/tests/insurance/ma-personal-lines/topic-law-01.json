      "question": "Which type of risk involves the possibility of loss only, with no opportunity for gain, and is generally the only type of risk that is insurable?",

        "B": "Pure Risk",
        "C": "Fundamental Risk",
        "D": "Dynamic Risk"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pure risk provides only for the possibility of a loss. Property and casualty insurance protects against pure risk only. Speculative risk involves an opportunity for gain that could result in loss (e.g., gambling) and cannot be insured.",
      "distractor_logic": "Speculative risk involves gain or loss. Fundamental and Dynamic risks are not the primary terms used to define insurability in the provided text."

        "C": "Declarations",
        "D": "Exclusions"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The declarations page 'personalizes' the policy and provides an assortment of information regarding the property or exposures being insured, including the name/address of the insured, coverage limits, and premium.",
      "distractor_logic": "The Insuring Agreement describes the promise to pay. Conditions identify responsibilities. Exclusions identify what is not covered."

        "D": "Not less than $500 nor more than $5,000"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "An insurer or producer shall not pay a commission... to a person for selling insurance unless such person is duly licensed. Anyone violating this regulation may be fined not less than $50 nor more than $500.",
      "distractor_logic": "$10-$100 is for Impersonation. $100-$1,000 is for Perjury. $500-$5,000 is for operating an auto without insurance."

        "C": "Moral Hazard",
        "D": "Legal Hazard"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Moral hazard may heighten the chance of a loss due to the dishonest character of an insured. An insured who intentionally damages his or her own property... is an illustration of this type of hazard.",
      "distractor_logic": "Physical hazards are tangible conditions (e.g., gasoline storage). Morale hazards involve carelessness or indifference (e.g., leaving keys in car)."

        "D": "The insured carries Comprehensive coverage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Part 8 covers direct and accidental damage to the covered auto if the insured is not more than 50% at-fault and he or she can identify the responsible driver.",
      "distractor_logic": "A is incorrect because the insured must be *not more than* 50% at fault. C is incorrect because the driver must be identified. D is incorrect as Comprehensive is a separate part (Part 9)."

        "C": "Intervening Cause",
        "D": "Assumption of Risk"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Under the Intervening Cause defense, a defendant possesses no liability if an injury to a third party is caused by a separate unrelated cause which interrupts a series chain of events.",
      "distractor_logic": "Comparative negligence apportions fault based on degree. Last clear chance applies if the injured party could have avoided the loss. Assumption of risk applies when danger is voluntarily accepted."

        "D": "60 days"

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Massachusetts regulations state that once an insurer receives a written proof of loss from an insured, it must pay the claim, if legitimate, within thirty (30) days.",
      "distractor_logic": "15 days applies to the notice of decision to repair/replace. 60 days is the timeframe for an insured to demand appraisers if there is a dispute."

        "C": "Reduction",
        "D": "Avoidance"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sharing involves risk distributed among an assortment of persons. Each party agrees to assume a specific portion of the loss.",
      "distractor_logic": "Retention is assuming the risk oneself. Reduction is minimizing severity. Avoidance is eliminating the activity entirely."

      "category": "Property & Casualty Basics",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A binder provides temporary insurance and is usually not good for more than 30 days... Massachusetts fire regulations specifically mention binders may be extended for up to 30 days.",
      "distractor_logic": "60 days is listed as a possibility in general text, but 30 days is the specific MA fire regulation limit mentioned."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Safe Driver Insurance Plan was established by CAR (Commonwealth Auto Reinsurers) to modify premium rates based on accident frequency, moving violations, etc..",
      "distractor_logic": "The Division of Insurance regulates. The RMV handles licensing. The AG prosecutes illegal activity."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A mutual insurer is an insurance company without capital stock that is owned by its policyholders. Mutual insurers issue participating policies.",
      "distractor_logic": "Stock companies are owned by stockholders. Risk Retention Groups are group-owned liability insurers for specific businesses."

      "explanation": "Part 5 also includes coverage for bail bonds up to $250 if the insured or a family member is arrested as a result of an auto accident.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A direct loss involves direct physical loss to tangible property... An indirect loss is an additional form of loss that results from a direct physical loss (e.g., loss of use, loss of income).",
      "distractor_logic": "B, C, and D are incorrect definitions. Coverage type and valuation method do not define direct vs. indirect."

      "explanation": "Once property is scheduled individually it is: (1) taken out of the Coverage C limit... (3) covered against mysterious disappearance: and (4) not affected by a deductible.",
