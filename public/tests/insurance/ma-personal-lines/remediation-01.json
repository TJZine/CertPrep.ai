      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A morale hazard results from the indifferent or careless attitudes of an insured, such as leaving a car unlocked. This is distinct from a moral hazard (dishonesty) or physical hazard.",
      "distractor_logic": "A describes a physical hazard. B describes a moral hazard. D is unrelated to the standard hazard definitions."

        "C": "Adhesion",
        "D": "Conditional"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A unilateral contract is one where only one party makes a promise. The insurer promises to pay covered claims; the insured does not promise to pay premiums (though they must do so to keep coverage in force, that is a condition, not a promise).",
      "distractor_logic": "A refers to unequal exchange of value. C refers to the contract being drawn up by one party. D refers to the contract relying on conditions being met."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Estoppel prevents (stops) a party from re-asserting a right they previously waived or from denying a fact they previously established, if the other party relied on it to their detriment.",
      "distractor_logic": "A is the voluntary relinquishment of a right. C is the transfer of rights of recovery. D is a statement guaranteed to be true."

      "explanation": "Liability policies provide unlimited legal expenses for defense. These expenses are paid 'in addition' to the policy's coverage limit or limit of liability.",
      "distractor_logic": "A is incorrect; defense costs do not reduce the limit. C is incorrect; defense is provided even if the suit is groundless. D is incorrect; defense costs usually have no deductible."
