        "C": "Legal purpose",
        "D": "Consideration"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "According to the Contract Law section in Chapter 1-1, the four elements required for a contract to be legal and enforceable are (1) agreement, (2) consideration, (3) competent parties, and (4) legal purpose. Notarization is not listed as a required element.",

        "A": "It is drawn up by one party and accepted by the other",
        "B": "Both parties must tell the truth and rely on each other's statements",
        "C": "One party may recover more in value than they have parted with based on an uncertain future event",
        "D": "The insurer's promise to pay is conditional upon the payment of premiums"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Chapter 1-2 defines an aleatory contract as one where 'one party may recover more in value than he or she has parted with based upon a possible future event.' It involves an unequal exchange of value (small premium for large coverage).",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A describes a Contract of Adhesion. Option B describes Utmost Good Faith. Option D describes a Conditional Contract."

        "B": "Three hours",
        "C": "Four hours",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "As stated in Chapter 1-7 under Types of Construction, fire-resistive construction generally 'includes fire walls within the structure... that usually confines or prevents damage for at least two hours.'",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (One hour) refers to 'Modified Fire-Resistive' construction. Options B and C are not thresholds mentioned in the source text for this classification."

        "C": "Warranty",
        "D": "Misrepresentation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Chapter 1-4 defines Waiver as 'the intentional abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of a known right.' If an insurer waives a right, they cannot later deny a claim based on that right.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option B (Estoppel) is related but distinct; it prevents a party from re-asserting a right after a false statement was relied upon by another. Option C (Warranty) is a guaranteed statement. Option D (Misrepresentation) is a false statement."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Chapter 2-2 states that 'Pure risk provides only for the possibility of a loss.' This is the only type of risk that Property and Casualty insurance protects against.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (Speculative risk) involves the possibility of gain or loss (e.g., gambling). Options C and D are not the primary classifications defined in the text's introduction to risk."

      "explanation": "Chapter 2-5 explicitly defines Actual Cash Value (ACV) as 'replacement cost minus depreciation.'",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (Market Value) is based on what property would sell for. Option B (Agreed Value) is a specific agreed amount. Option C (Functional Replacement Cost) involves replacing with less expensive but working equivalents."

      "explanation": "Chapter 3-3 explains that under Comparative Negligence, 'the court determines and apportions the negligence of each party and awards damages proportionately.'",

        "C": "It is also known as absolute liability",
        "D": "It imposes liability without regard to fault"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Chapter 3-4 defines Strict (or Absolute) Liability as liability imposed 'without regard to fault.' Therefore, the injured party does NOT need to prove negligence. The other statements are true.",
      "distractor_logic": "Options A, C, and D are all true characteristics of Strict Liability. Option B is false because strict liability removes the burden of proving negligence."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Chapter 4-2 states that the DP-1 Basic Form covers 'loss by fire, lightning and internal explosion.' Vandalism must be added by endorsement for an additional premium; it is not automatic.",

      "explanation": "Chapter 4-3 states that for Coverage B, 'the named insured may select whatever amount of protection desired up to 10% of the Coverage A limit of liability.'",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A is the limit for trees/shrubs in some forms. Option B is the limit for fair rental value in some contexts. Option D is the limit for Personal Property (Coverage C) in Homeowners policies."
