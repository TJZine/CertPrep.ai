      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "question": "Which characteristic of an insurance contract states that the insured must perform a specific act (pay premiums) in exchange for the insurer's promise to pay claims, making it a 'promise in exchange for an act'?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Aleatory",
        "B": "Unilateral",
        "C": "Conditional",
        "D": "Personal"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A unilateral contract is described as an 'act in exchange for a promise' or a 'promise in exchange for an act already performed.' Only one party (the insurer) makes a legally enforceable promise.",
      "distractor_logic": "Aleatory refers to unequal value exchange. Conditional means the contract requires specific conditions to be met. Personal means it covers the person, not the property."

        "D": "$25,000 per violation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Anyone who violates a cease and desist order may be fined up to $10,000 per violation and be subject to license suspension or revocation.",
      "distractor_logic": "$1,000 is the fine for general unfair practices or failing to appear. $500 is for unlicensed compensation. $25,000 is not a standard fine limit in this section."

        "B": "Short rate",
        "C": "Flat rate",
        "D": "Earned rate"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Property and liability contracts involve two basic cancellation concepts: short rate when an insured cancels the policy, and pro rata when the insurer cancels.",
      "distractor_logic": "Pro rata applies when the *insurer* cancels. Flat rate implies the policy was never in force."

        "D": "Demand the insurer reveal the source of all underwriting data."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The applicant has a right to request a copy of the report from the *provider* (the reporting agency), not the insurer. If information is incorrect, they may request it be corrected.",
      "distractor_logic": "The law does not require the insurer to send the copy; the consumer must go to the agency. Suing is not the immediate remedy provided by the Act."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "To appoint a producer as its agent, the appointing insurer shall file a notice of appointment within 15 days from the date the agency contract is executed.",
      "distractor_logic": "30 days is the timeframe for notifying the Commissioner of *termination*. 10 and 45 days are incorrect for appointments."

        "D": "The applicant has previously had flood insurance."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The waiting period may be waived if a new policy is being written in conjunction with a mortgage loan.",
      "distractor_logic": "Payment of premium starts the clock but does not waive the wait. Program status and prior insurance do not automatically waive the statutory waiting period."

        "C": "3 years",
        "D": "5 years"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Producers and adjusters must maintain any complaints received for a period of two years with a record of their disposition.",
      "distractor_logic": "3 years is the license renewal period. 5 years is the domestic insurer exam frequency. 1 year is incorrect."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Robbery involves a person-to-person encounter between the robber and victim or a physical threat. Burglary requires visible signs of forcible entry but generally no person-to-person encounter.",
      "distractor_logic": "A describes Burglary. C is incorrect (robbery can involve any property). D is Embezzlement or Larceny."

        "D": "A business entity producer"

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "An individual who holds a nonresident license in this State is exempt from the C.E. requirement if they are subject to a C.E. requirement in their home State.",
      "distractor_logic": "New resident producers must still complete CE. Auto producers are not exempt. Business entities are licensed differently, but the individuals within them must comply."

        "D": "Per Occurrence Limit"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Aggregate limits provide a maximum limit of liability for the total amount of losses occurring during the policy period. Every claim paid reduces this limit.",
      "distractor_logic": "Split and Combined Single limits generally apply per accident. Per Occurrence limits reinstate after each loss."

      "distractor_logic": "15 days is for the *initial* appointment notice. 10 and 60 days are incorrect."
