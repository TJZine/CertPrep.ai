      "question": "Which of the following terms describes a condition that heightens or increases the possibility of a loss arising?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Peril",
        "B": "Risk",
        "C": "Hazard",
        "D": "Indemnity"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A hazard is defined as a condition that heightens or increases the chance of a loss arising. For example, a pile of oily rags in a garage is a physical hazard that increases the chance of a fire.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (Peril) is the actual cause of the loss (e.g., fire). Option B (Risk) is the uncertainty concerning possible loss. Option D (Indemnity) is the principle of restoring the insured to their pre-loss financial condition."

      "question": "All of the following are elements required for a risk to be insurable EXCEPT:",
      "options": {
        "A": "The loss must be catastrophic in nature",
        "B": "The loss must be measurable and definite",
        "C": "The loss must be accidental",
        "D": "The law of large numbers must be applicable"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Insurable risks must NOT be catastrophic (like war or nuclear hazard) because such losses could bankrupt the insurer. Insurers need to avoid concentrating risk to prevent catastrophic payouts.",
      "distractor_logic": "Options B, C, and D are all required elements of an insurable risk. The loss must be definable financially, unintended/accidental, and part of a large enough pool of similar units for the law of large numbers to apply."

      "question": "An insurance contract is considered aleatory because:",
      "options": {
        "A": "It is drawn up by one party and accepted by the other",
        "B": "One party may recover more in value than they have parted with based on an uncertain future event",
        "C": "Both parties must tell the truth and act in good faith",
        "D": "The contract is personal and cannot be assigned without consent"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Aleatory contracts are characterized by an unequal exchange of value. The insured pays a small premium, and the insurer may pay a large claim if a specific uncertain event occurs. Performance is conditioned upon this future event.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A describes a Contract of Adhesion. Option C describes the principle of Utmost Good Faith. Option D describes the Personal nature of the contract."

      "options": {
        "A": "Physical hazard",
        "B": "Moral hazard",
        "C": "Morale hazard",
        "D": "Legal hazard"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A morale hazard arises from an attitude of indifference or carelessness because one is insured. Leaving keys in an unlocked car demonstrates a careless attitude that increases the chance of loss.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (Physical) refers to physical conditions like a pothole or faulty wiring. Option B (Moral) implies a dishonest character or intent to defraud (like faking a theft). Option D is not a standard hazard classification in this context."

        "C": "Intent to cause harm",
        "D": "Proximate cause linking the breach to the damage"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Negligence is by definition an unintentional tort. If there is intent to cause harm, it is not negligence; it is an intentional tort. Therefore, intent is NOT a required element of negligence.",
      "distractor_logic": "Options A, B, and D are the classic four elements of negligence: Duty, Breach, Damages, and Proximate Cause."

        "D": "Contributory negligence"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Vicarious liability (also called imputed liability) occurs when one person is legally responsible for the acts of another due to a special relationship, such as parent/child or employer/employee.",
      "distractor_logic": "Options A and C (Strict/Absolute liability) apply to dangerous activities or products where fault does not need to be proven. Option D is a defense against negligence, not a type of liability assignment."

        "C": "Market Value",
        "D": "Stated Amount"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Replacement Cost is the amount needed to replace damaged property with new materials of like kind and quality at today's prices, without deducting for depreciation.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (ACV) is Replacement Cost MINUS depreciation. Option C (Market Value) is what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller. Option D (Stated Amount) is a specific agreed-upon value, often for classic cars."

      "explanation": "Standard property policies generally exclude vandalism and glass breakage if the building has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days immediately prior to the loss.",
      "distractor_logic": "Options A, B, and D are incorrect timeframes for the standard vacancy provision found in Dwelling and Homeowners policies."

        "C": "Assumption of risk",
        "D": "Intervening cause"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Contributory negligence is a strict common law defense that states if the injured party contributed to their own injury in any way (even 1%), they cannot recover damages from the other party.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (Comparative) allows for proportional recovery based on fault. Option C (Assumption of Risk) applies when a person voluntarily exposes themselves to danger. Option D (Intervening Cause) breaks the chain of causation."

        "C": "$55,000",
        "D": "$5,000"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Debris removal is an additional coverage, but usually included within the policy limit. Since the total of the loss ($60,000) plus the debris removal ($5,000) is $65,000, and this is well within the $200,000 limit, the policy pays the full $65,000.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A fails to include the covered debris removal. Option C incorrectly subtracts debris removal. Option D pays only for the debris removal."

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "According to Massachusetts law, an insurer must provide 45 days written notice to the insured if they intend to non-renew a property insurance policy.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (10 days) is typically for non-payment of premium. Option B (20 days) is the notice required for cancellation of an auto policy or notice to a mortgagee for cancellation. Option C (30 days) is not the standard non-renewal notice period in MA."

        "D": "The Attorney General"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Commissioner of Insurance has the power to issue a Cease and Desist order when they believe a producer or insurer is engaging in unfair sales practices or violating insurance laws.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option B (Legislature) makes the laws. Option D (Attorney General) prosecutes criminal activity. Option A (Governor) appoints the Commissioner but does not issue these specific regulatory orders."

        "C": "Defamation",
        "D": "Coercion"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Rebating is offering anything of value not specified in the policy contract (like tickets, cash, or gifts) as an inducement to buy insurance.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (Twisting) involves misrepresentation to induce a policy lapse. Option C (Defamation) is making false statements about a competitor. Option D (Coercion) is forcing someone to buy insurance (e.g., as a condition of a loan)."

        "D": "Refusing to pay a claim when liability is not reasonably clear"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "It is NOT an unfair practice to refuse to pay a claim if liability is not clear or if the claim is not covered. Insurers have a duty to investigate and only pay valid claims.",
