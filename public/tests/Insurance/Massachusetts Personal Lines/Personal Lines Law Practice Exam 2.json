        "D": "365 days"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Chapter 9-3 of the text states that a temporary license may be issued to a surviving spouse or court-appointed designee for a period of 180 days and does not require a State examination.",
      "distractor_logic": "90 days applies to the window for new residents to apply for a license. 120 and 365 days are not standard temporary license durations in MA."

        "D": "A voluntary relinquishment of a known legal right."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "According to Chapter 1-3, a warranty is a statement made by the applicant/insured that is guaranteed to be absolutely true. It is made part of the contract. Representations are statements believed to be true.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Chapter 3-3 explains that under the common law defense of Assumption of Risk, an insured is absolved of liability if the injured third party assumed the risk of injury voluntarily.",
      "distractor_logic": "Last Clear Chance favors the injured party. Vicarious Liability assigns liability to another. Comparative Negligence apportions fault."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Chapter 9-15 states that a lender may not inform a borrower that in order to receive a loan he or she must purchase insurance from a specific insurer or agency. This is coercion or intimidation.",
      "distractor_logic": "Rebating is offering value to induce a sale. Twisting is inducing a lapse to sell a new policy. Defamation is false statements about a competitor."
