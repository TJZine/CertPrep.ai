        "A": "Express authority",
        "B": "Implied authority",
        "C": "Apparent authority",
        "D": "Absolute authority"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Implied authority is not specifically identified in the agency agreement but is an extension of the agent's regular duties. For example, it is implied that an agent authorized to sell insurance can also collect the initial premium.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (Express) is written in the contract. Option C (Apparent) is what the public perceives the agent to have based on their actions. Option D is not a standard type of authority."

      "options": {
        "A": "Contract of Adhesion",
        "B": "Aleatory Contract",
        "C": "Unilateral Contract",
        "D": "Personal Contract"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A Contract of Adhesion is drawn up by one party (the insurer) and offered on a 'take it or leave it' basis. Since the insured has no say in the wording, any ambiguity is construed against the drafter (the insurer).",
      "distractor_logic": "Option B (Aleatory) refers to unequal exchange of value. Option C (Unilateral) means only one party makes a legally enforceable promise. Option D (Personal) means it covers the person, not the property."

        "C": "Transfer",
        "D": "Reduction"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Purchasing insurance is the most common method of Risk Transfer, where the financial burden of a loss is shifted from the individual to the insurance company.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (Avoidance) eliminates the risk entirely. Option B (Retention) involves paying for losses out of pocket (like a deductible). Option D (Reduction) minimizes the severity of a loss (like installing sprinklers)."

        "C": "Indemnity",
        "D": "Subrogation"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Estoppel prevents a party from re-asserting a right they previously waived or denied if another party has relied on that statement to their detriment. The insurer is 'estopped' from denying coverage due to the agent's false statement.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (Waiver) is the voluntary relinquishment of a known right. Option C (Indemnity) is the principle of restoring the insured to their pre-loss condition. Option D (Subrogation) is the transfer of recovery rights."

        "D": "Consideration"
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Consideration is the binding force of the contract. For the insured, it is the premium paid and representations made. For the insurer, it is the promise to pay claims.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A refers to the contract's legality. Option B refers to the legal capacity of the parties. Option C refers to the Offer and Acceptance."

      "explanation": "The Declarations page 'personalizes' the policy, listing who is insured, what is covered, where it is located, when the policy is in force, and how much coverage applies.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A describes the insurer's promise to pay. Option B lists the duties of both parties. Option D lists what is NOT covered."

        "C": "Punitive damages",
        "D": "Statutory damages"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "General damages are compensatory damages awarded for intangible, non-economic losses such as pain and suffering, which are difficult to measure in specific dollar amounts.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option A (Special) covers tangible economic losses like medical bills. Option C (Punitive) is intended to punish the wrongdoer. Option D (Statutory) is set by law."

        "C": "Consequential loss",
        "D": "Proximate loss"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Smoke damage to the inventory is a Direct Loss (physical damage) caused by the peril of fire/smoke. An indirect loss would be the loss of income while the store is closed for repairs.",
      "distractor_logic": "Options A and C (Indirect/Consequential) refer to financial loss resulting from the loss of use of the property, not the physical damage itself. Option D is not a standard loss classification."

        "D": "100%"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The total insurance is $400,000 ($100k + $300k). Policy A holds $100,000 of that total. $100,000 / $400,000 = 25%.",
      "distractor_logic": "Option B (33%) would be correct if the total was $300k. Option C (50%) represents contribution by equal shares. Option D (100%) implies Policy A is primary."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "A binder is a temporary contract of insurance generally valid for up to 30 days while the actual policy is being issued.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Defamation involves making false or derogatory statements about a competitor's financial condition or business practices calculated to injure their reputation.",

      "distractor_logic": "Option A is false; eligibility standards exist. Option B is false; it is an association of all licensed insurers. Option D is false; generally, vacant/abandoned properties are ineligible."
