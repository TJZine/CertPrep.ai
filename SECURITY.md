# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

> [!CAUTION]
> **Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We take the security of CertPrep.ai seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Email:** [security@certprep.ai](mailto:security@certprep.ai)

**Security.txt:** We publish a [security.txt](https://certprep.ai/.well-known/security.txt) file for automated discovery of our security policy and contact information.

**PGP Key:** Not currently provided; please contact us via email and request an encrypted channel if needed.

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Type | Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass) |
| Location | Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue |
| Steps | Step-by-step instructions to reproduce |
| Impact | Potential impact of the vulnerability |
| Proof | Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible) |

### Response Timeline

| Phase | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Initial Response | Within 48 hours |
| Status Update | Within 5 business days |
| Resolution Target | Within 30 days (complexity dependent) |

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- ✅ Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations
- ✅ Avoid destruction of data or service interruption
- ✅ Do not access or modify data belonging to others
- ✅ Report findings promptly and give reasonable time for remediation
- ✅ Do not publicly disclose before agreed timeline

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Password Hashing | Supabase (bcrypt) |
| Session Management | Supabase Auth with secure cookies |
| Cookie Security | `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Path=/` |
| Row-Level Security | Enforced per-table with `auth.uid()` owner checks (see RLS policy checklist below) |

### Data Protection

| Data Type | Protection Method |
|-----------|-------------------|
| In Transit | TLS 1.3 encryption |
| At Rest (Server) | Supabase encryption |
| At Rest (Client) | IndexedDB (see note below) |

> [!NOTE]
> Local data in IndexedDB is not encrypted at rest. Use **Settings → Data Management → Reset** on shared devices to clear local quizzes/results.

### RLS Policy Checklist (Supabase)

For each user-owned table (e.g., `results`), ensure:

```sql
ALTER TABLE results ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY results_select_owner ON results FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY results_insert_owner ON results FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY results_update_owner ON results FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id) WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY results_delete_owner ON results FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

> Verify equivalent owner-scoped policies exist for any additional user-data tables.

### Content Security

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| XSS Prevention | React's default escaping + `sanitizeHTML()` |
| CSRF Protection | SameSite cookies + origin validation |
| Input Validation | Server-side validation on all inputs |
