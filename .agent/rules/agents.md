# Agent Playbook – CertPrep.ai

## Mission

- Ship CertPrep.ai features quickly while preserving correctness, accessibility, security, and performance.
- Prefer incremental, low-risk changes with clear validation steps.

## Workflow (Codex + MCP)

1. Clarify scope and constraints
   - Confirm sandbox mode, approvals, network access, and deadlines.
   - Restate the task in 1–2 sentences before changing code.
2. Inspect context before coding
   - Use Codanna first for code understanding:
     - `semantic_search_with_context` → find relevant symbols and files.
     - `analyze_impact` → understand dependencies and change radius.
   - Use `rg`/`rg --files` only for quick literal searches or file discovery.
   - Use `cat`/`sed` for small reads (≤ ~250 lines at a time).
3. Plan the work
   - use context7 to retrieve relevant docs to better understand best practices.
   - utilize sequential thinking for planning.
   - For non-trivial tasks, create/update a short `update_plan` with 3–6 steps.
   - Keep steps small, testable, and ordered by dependency.
4. Implement changes
   - Prefer minimal, focused edits with `apply_patch`.
   - Implement with strict typing, accessibility, and security in mind; avoid `any`.
   - When editing existing code, re-check impact with Codanna (`analyze_impact`) if the change could affect multiple call sites.
5. Validate behavior
   - Run targeted tests or scripts when feasible (`npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, or feature-specific commands).
   - If validation cannot be run, call it out explicitly and describe how to validate.
6. Summarize the work
   - Summarize changes concisely with file references (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx:42`).
   - Note validation status and any follow-up risks or TODOs.

## Coding Principles

- TypeScript strictness: explicit return types, handle null/undefined, no implicit any.
- Security: sanitize user input (use `sanitizeHTML`), avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless sanitized, protect secrets.
- Accessibility: ARIA labels for interactive elements, keyboard support, visible focus states.
- Performance: avoid unnecessary re-renders; memoize/derive state when helpful; keep dependencies light.
- Error handling: graceful fallbacks, user-friendly errors, no silent failures.

## New Constraints & Reminders (Mobile/Sanitization/Modals)

- Sanitization: Always use `sanitizeHTML` from `src/lib/sanitize` (isomorphic-dompurify) for any rendered HTML. Do not reintroduce SSR/CSR branches. If adjusting the allowlist, add/adjust tests.
- Modals: Use the shared `Modal` component so the global scroll-lock counter stays correct. Avoid writing to `document.body.style.overflow` elsewhere. If a change requires it, flag that `agents.md` may need updating.
- Mobile header: Preserve focus trap and Esc-close on the mobile menu. Include any new focusable elements in the trap logic.
- Overflow guards: Keep `overflow-x-hidden` on page shells (e.g., quiz layout) and use `break-words` on long text to prevent horizontal scroll. Only wrap intentional horizontal scrollers in `overflow-x-auto`.
- Bundle note: If expanding sanitization/rich text, verify allowed tags/attrs and, if concerned, run bundle analysis to confirm DOMPurify impact is acceptable.

## Available Tools (MCP)

- **Codanna (code graph/search)** – best for codebase queries and impact analysis.
- **Sequential Thinking** – log and review thought steps for complex tasks.
- **Ripgrep** – fast code/text search (`rg`/`rg --files`); prefer over `find`/`grep` for speed.
- **Fetch** – pull external URLs when allowed (network access may be restricted).
- **Context7** – fetch external library docs (resolve library ID then get docs).

When in doubt: prefer Codanna for code understanding, `rg` for quick literal grep-style queries, and only then fall back to manual navigation.

### Codanna MCP Tools

Tool priority (for this project):

- **Tier 1 (default entry points)**:
  - `semantic_search_with_context` – natural-language search with rich symbol + usage context.
  - `analyze_impact` – full dependency and change-radius analysis for a specific symbol.
- **Tier 2 (targeted lookups)**:
  - `find_symbol` – locate symbols by exact or fuzzy name.
  - `get_calls` – see what a function calls.
  - `find_callers` – see who calls a function.
- **Tier 3 (supporting tools)**:
  - `search_symbols` – broader/fuzzier symbol search when the name is unclear.
  - `semantic_search_docs` – search docs/comments by natural language.
  - `get_index_info` – confirm index status and languages indexed.

Recommended Codanna workflow:

1. Use `semantic_search_with_context` to find relevant functions/components/types from a natural-language query (e.g., “where do we render the practice exams list?”).
2. Use `analyze_impact` on key symbols before making changes to see:
   - Who calls them.
   - What they call.
   - Where they are composed or used as types.
3. Use `find_symbol`, `get_calls`, and `find_callers` for precise follow-ups:
   - Confirm you’ve covered all call sites before refactors.
   - Verify no unused or dead paths remain.
4. After implementing non-trivial changes, re-run `analyze_impact` on affected symbols to double-check that you considered all dependents.
5. Use `semantic_search_docs` when you need conceptual guidance from inline docs or comments (e.g., “how are attempts persisted offline?”).

## Productivity Tips

- Use `rg` for searches; `rg --files` for listings. Pipe to `sed -n` for context.
- Prefer `apply_patch` for focused edits; avoid destructive commands.
- Note sandbox/approval limits; request escalations only when necessary.
- Keep responses concise with actionable next steps and file references.

## Validation Checklist

- Lint/build/test status reported.
- Types and nullability covered.
- XSS/SSR safety reviewed when rendering user content.
- ARIA/keyboard/focus verified for interactive UI.
- Edge cases handled (empty lists, division by zero, timeouts).
